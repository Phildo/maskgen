Really simple really quick c++ program to generate all hashcat-style mask combinations that exhaustively-and-exactly cover n-length passwords w/ m character sets, ensuring at least one of each character set occurs in the password.

Installation

`make #alternatively, just gcc maskgen.cpp -o maskgen`

Run

`maskgen 2 3 #maskgen n_sets n_characters`

Will create all combinations of n_sets of length n_characters, throwing out all possibilities that don't have at least one of each set.
That's it! glhf
